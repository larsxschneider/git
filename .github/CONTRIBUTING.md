## Contributing to Git

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to Git! Please be advised, that the Git community does not use github.com for their contributions. Instead, we use a [mailing list](http://public-inbox.org/git/) for code submissions, code reviews, and bug reports.

Please [read the maintainer notes](http://repo.or.cz/w/git.git?a=blob_plain;f=MaintNotes;hb=todo) to learn how the Git
project is managed, and how you can work with it. In addition, we highly recommend you to [read our submission guidelines](../Documentation/SubmittingPatches).

If you prefer video, then [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7i_qQW__q4&feature=youtu.be&t=6m4s) might be useful to you as the presenter walks you through the contribution process by example.
